Banking System
----------------------------------

This project is a simple web-based banking system implemented using HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript. It allows users to log in, sign up, and manage a basic bank account. Users can deposit, 
withdraw, and transfer money between accounts. The system includes a transaction history
feature, displaying a scrollable window of recent transactions.
